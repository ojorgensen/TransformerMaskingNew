# Repo Instructions

Most experiments for the project were conducted using Google Colab, using code from this repo. 

In order to reproduce these the folder titled Colab-Folder can be uploaded to google drive, and the experiments can then be run. A Pro+ subscription may be required.

The activation addition experiments use the repo found at https://github.com/ojorgensen/activation_additions/tree/ole-dev. This is a fork of https://github.com/montemac/activation_additions with some changes to make it suitable for my experiments.
